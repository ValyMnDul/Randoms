# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!  
This document explains the process and rules for contributions, ensuring the codebase stays clean and consistent.

## 1. Getting Started
1. **Fork** this repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ValyMnDul/ValyMnDul.git
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your change:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## 2. Code Guidelines
  
  - Follow the existing code style (prettier).  
  - Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.  
  - Do not leave unused or commented-out code.  
  - Test all changes locally before committing.
  
## 3. Commit Messages
Commit messages should be **clear and descriptive**, so that anyone reading the history can understand what changed without looking at the code.

Guidelines:
- Keep messages concise but meaningful.
- Use the present tense (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
- If fixing a bug or adding a feature, mention it in the message.
- Optionally, reference related issues or pull requests (e.g., `Fix #42`).

 ## 4. Pull Requests

- Ensure your branch is up-to-date with main:   
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git merge origin/main
  ```
- PRs must clearly describe the changes.
- Attach screenshots or logs if relevant.
- One PR = One feature or bug fix (do not mix unrelated changes).

## 5. Licence

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as the project.
